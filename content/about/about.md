We started Ad Astra Sailing Adventures to introduce my passion of sailing to my friends and their friends (and their friends!) on board our 2012 [Lagoon 450](http://www.cata-lagoon.com/lagoon_450_uk.php).

[The Crew of Ad Astra](/about/team)

The Lagoon 450 is in my opinion the most luxurious sailing platform that anyone can learn to sail with a friend for crew.   After just a few days of training, I felt comfortable taking command of the boat.  I consider it a personal mission to get as many of my friends and their families out on the water and teach them how easy a large catamaran is to sail.

Ad Astra is Latin for “To the Stars”, in a previous life I was a space scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on the UV Spectrometer for Galileo and Cassini and trying to find a path to terraforming Mars.  Space is still a deep interest to me, and getting out on a sailboat, dreaming of taking off across the horizon to distant shores fills a hunger for me.

SCUBA Diving is a natural extension and complement to my passion for space exploration and sailing by exploring the alien world right here in our seas and oceans.  On Ad Astra we offer custom liveaboard diving for just one party at a time.

When you sail your own boat, the regular world fades away like peeling skin.  My eyes open up, my brain “breathes” open relaxed thoughts.  I do not feel the need to rush my words, and my eyes graze the water’s horizon surveying my open kingdom.  This is the time for deep, contented thoughts.  What do I want to do with the rest of my life?  Where do I want to go? What do I want to experience?  What do I want to create?

I always feel a much more deep connection with my two boys, Kyle and Max and the whole rest of my family when I take the time to go out sailing.

This is what I want to share with the world, and I will start with my friends.  With you.  I am curious what deep thoughts come to your mind when sailing on Ad Astra!

C’mon, look around read a bit, check out the pictures, think about it and then send me an email and lets figure out the absolutely most awesome adventure for you and your crew!

Warm cheers,
