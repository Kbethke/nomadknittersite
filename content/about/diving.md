The whole family dives, Erik is a SDI/TDI Instructor, Kyle is a tech diver that lasts forever with his sidemount system, and Max is so unbelievably chill under water that it is freaky.

We offer private, custom liveaboard diving experiences.

We accommodate single parties of up to four people in two cabins.  Each cabin with their own bathroom.

This means that Ad Astra is yours for your adventure, all of the luxury of a private sailing charter PLUS customized diving.

* Perhaps you are a tech diver with your own rebreather or sidemount system and want to be down for 100 minutes+?  No problem.

* Want to dive solo and have the skills to back it up – no problem.

* Want to check out a dive site in the afternoon, have a meal and then dive the same dive as a night dive?  You got it.

* Want a buddy for a wreck penetration dive, sweet!

* You want a buddy for a decompression dive?  Sure – love them!

* Do not know how to dive?  We would love to teach you to dive.  Our open water course is longer and much more thorough than a typical resort course.  As Erik is a father with two boys that dive, he loves teaching children to dive.
