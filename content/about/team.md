After 20+ years of experience creating games and leading teams (Starfleet Commannd, GoPets, FarmVille, MafiaWars and Bee Cave Games), Erik needed do some deep time with his family.

No better way to reconnect with your family, than sailing around the world as slow as possible!

The Bethkes have been sailing [Ad Astra](https://www.sailadastra.com/) around the Caribbean for the last
two years. 

After settling into the cruising life and building the [2100 watts of solar](/posts/solar), [1400 Ah of LiFePO4](/posts/lithium), the Bethkes decided to make a game together - [Million on Mars](https://milliononmars.com).
