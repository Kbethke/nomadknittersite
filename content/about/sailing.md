# Boutique Sailing Charters

We offer private, custom sailing adventures for individuals, couples and families.

We have 1 or 2 cabins available and that each sleep 2 and have their own adjoined private bathroom.

We are especially happy to have families with children to share these blue water experiences.

Adventure on Ad Astra is by invite or recommendation.
