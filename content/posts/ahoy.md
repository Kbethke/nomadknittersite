Ad Astra is wrapping up her stay in fabulous Bonaire. We are heading to the Cayman for the winter holidays.
 
Along the way to the Caymans, we will stop in Curacao, Aruba – and most exciting – Île-à-Vache!

That is right – Ad Astra is going to stop in at [Captain Morgan’s old base](https://thenerdynomad.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/ile-a-vache_guide/):
We are doing private sailing and diving charters. We are doing this as a low-key way to share our adventures with friends and cool people recommended by our friends.
 
We have 1 or 2 cabins (sleeps 2 adults) available each with their own private shower and toilet. We serve 3 meals a day, and you know we have a good set of libations.

## Diving:
Lots of gear: own air compressor, 9 tanks, 8 BCDs, 6 regulator sets, U/W lights – and more
 
If you are a tech diver or advanced diver, you would understand how valuable it is to have your own custom liveaboard experience: Dive your own plans. Rebreather, sidemount, solo, whatever your speciality is, once you have dived a checkout dive with me, we will tailor the experience to *you*, not make you conform with the boat.
 
For new divers or folks curious about diving, I have taken the most rigorous training to be a SCUBA instructor under Chris Verstappen of TDS

## Upcoming Ad Astra Adventures:
 
November 20th: Aruba (5-7d) – stay with us on sunny Aruba – diving, day sailing and relaxing.
 
Dec 1st: Aruba (10-14d) to Île-à-Vache to Cayman Islands – cross the Caribbean Sea on an epic 3-day sail to Captain Morgan’s base. We will explore this gem of an island together and after 2-4 days we will set off downwind for the Cayman Islands. But check this out – first we will stop in at Cayman Brac and Little Cayman for reportedly the very best wall diving in the Caribbean with claimed 200+ ft visibility.
