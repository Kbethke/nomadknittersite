It is a beautiful Sunday afternoon and the sky is full of Kite Surfers at the headland that separates Secret Harbor from Prickly Bay.

I gave some thought to going over and checking them out, but it is so nice just relaxing on Ad Astra.  I cannot bring myself to move.  I can see why people drop the hook into Secret Harbor and never leaveâ€¦

I posted it on facebook and tagged David Bettner and he joked that he is popping into a plane and heading right over.  ðŸ™‚
