## Creating the new Ad Astra website 
I never really liked wordpress. First, it feels like old-tech (because it is ancient), and second good folks have kept trying to make it better and now it feels like a huge pile of slow jello (lots and lots of javascript).

I really like our hosting provider [dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com) and they have these slick 1-click installs for setting up a wordpress site. That works well enough, but editing wordpress sucks.  You either have the clunky WYSIWYG editor or their clunky text editor.  And the file uploads only works about 40% of the time.

The reusult was taht over time, I was posting fewer and fewer updates to our site.  Meanwhile on facebook the feed alorithm continues to be dominated by clickbait. As a natural task for our new game that we are building I needed to create a new webiste for the game.

So it was time to get up to speed and learn the latest in website tech.  From my research I settled on going with a static website generated by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  It is so much more fun and quick to be able to edit locally in sublime (insert your favorite text editor) and flick some fingers and see it rendering on a localhost in your browser.  Tweak, add, pop images around as easy as moving images around on your local files system.  Then when you the changes you want, push to a github repository for safe keeping.

And then it goes supercool in terms of deploying and hosting, now with all of teh cloud computing options available now - I chose [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  With netlify it automagically *watches* my github repsoitory where I have the website and will instantly grab the changes and re-build my site.  For a typical edit that means I can work in pure keyboard on my laptop, squirt off my git commands and 15-20 seconds later my changes are live on the internet!

This makes it sexy and addictive to add more content. You can bet you will be seeing a lot more updates from me!
